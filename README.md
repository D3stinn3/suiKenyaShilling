## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Metadata Mutability**: The token metadata is designed to be **mutable**. Ensure you **do not use the `freeze` function** if implementing metadata management on-chain.
- **Use Cases**: sKSH is ideal for digital payments, DeFi platforms, and tokenized commerce within the Kenyan ecosystem and beyond.

## üìà Potential Integrations

- Digital wallets
- Payment gateways
- Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
- Cross-border remittances
- Stable payment rails for apps on the Sui network

## ‚è≥ Vesting & Cliff Design Guide for Developers (Sui Blockchain)

This section is crafted for Sui Move developers implementing lockups, cliffs, and vesting mechanics on the Sui blockchain.

### üì¶ Airdrop Logic (Sui Move)

```move
public entry fun airdrop(
    sender: &signer,
    recipient: address,
    amount: u64,
    token: &mut Token
) {
    // Mint tokens to vesting object or direct recipient based on policy
    transfer::mint_to_recipient(sender, recipient, amount, token);
}
```

- Prefer wrapping recipient's tokens in a **vesting object** if lockup is required.
- Emit events for indexing and analytics.

---

### ‚è≥ Vesting Object Structure

```move
struct VestingSchedule has key {
    beneficiary: address,
    total_amount: u64,
    released: u64,
    start_time: u64,
    duration: u64,
    cliff: u64,
    created_at: u64,
}
```

- Store this object on-chain and index it using `table`.
- Reference Sui‚Äôs `Clock` object to get block timestamps (`clock::now_seconds()`).

---

### ü™ú Cliff and Vesting Claim Logic

```move
public fun claim_tokens(
    clock: &Clock,
    vesting: &mut VestingSchedule,
    token: &mut Token
): Result<(), E> {
    let current_time = clock::now_seconds(clock);

    if (current_time < vesting.created_at + vesting.cliff) {
        return Err(error::new(E::CliffNotReached));
    }

    let elapsed = current_time - vesting.start_time;
    let vested = min(
        vesting.total_amount,
        vesting.total_amount * elapsed / vesting.duration
    );
    let to_release = vested - vesting.released;
    vesting.released = vested;

    transfer::mint_to_recipient(...); // Add logic here

    Ok(())
}
```

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Governance and Control

Use `Shared` or `GovernanceCap` to:
- Unlock or pause token streams
- Trigger cliffs based on milestones (e.g., company staff growth)
- Modify or revoke vesting schedules (if necessary)

---

### üß† Notes for Sui Development

- Store `VestingSchedule` as objects ‚Äî leverage Sui‚Äôs object model.
- Use modules and capabilities for secure minting/claiming logic.
- Consider gas implications for large batch vesting claims.
- Use events for transparency and traceability.
## üß† Developer Notes

- Consider integrating with [OpenZeppelin's Vesting Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/ERC20#TokenVesting) as a base.
- Add admin functionality to modify vesting in case of strategic pivots.
- Ensure transparency: Allow public read functions for schedules and claimable balances.
- Governance functions should control critical release operations (e.g., unlocking for strategic partnerships).
